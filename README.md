# 9-online-store
In this project, I studied the interaction between the server and client parts of the application. The logic of their construction. User interaction logic, and build databases.

# technologies in the project

I used PostgreSQL for crate and work with database, and Postman for create and check API.\
API was created on REST principles.

# start app
in console:

9-online-store> cd server\
9-online-store>server> npm run dev\

it starts server part app
